## v0.15.0 - 2025-07-21
### Added
* Initial daemon mode workspace
* IP information to sysinfo metadata
* Additional compile time information to sysinfo and collection metadata
### Changed
* Lowered memory usage when parsing linux journal files
* Faster processing when compressing json output
* Do not return error if we fail to parse the full UsnJrnl. Instead artemis will log an error but return existing entries it has already parsed.

* Moved cron and shell history artifacts to API only
### Fixed
* Issue where artemis would not fully parse directory shellitems
* Issue where artemis would not fully parse malformed/malicious shortcut files
* Issue where artemis would use excessive memory when parsing the last macOS unifiedlog entries
* Issue where WMI parser improperly handled localization classes
### Dependencies
