# Runtime code

These `TypeScript` files are used to generate the `JavaScript` code that is used
to provide the minimal runtime environment for scripting with `Deno`.\
The goal is to create a runtime environment similar to the `deno_runtime` crate
but with a focus on digital forensics and incident response.
