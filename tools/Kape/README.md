# Kape2Toml

A small Python script to convert [KapeFiles](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles) to TOML format.

A Kape file is a YAML structure file

This should work on any provided KapeFile but was primarily tested against the KapeFiles at [KapeFiles](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles).

Do not commit the TOML files to this repo!
